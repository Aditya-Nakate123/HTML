<a name="Introduction"><b> Introduction</b> </a>
<p>In a world of data space where organizations deal with petabytes and exabytes of data,
 the era of Big Data emerged, and the essence of its storage also grew. It was a great challenge
 and concern for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when frameworks like Hadoop and 
 others solved the problem of storage, the focus shifted to the processing of data. Data Science plays
 a big role here. All those fancy Sci-fi movies you love to watch around can be turned into reality by 
 Data Science. Nowadays its growth has been increased in multiple ways and thus one should be ready for 
 our future by learning what it is and how can we add value to it.</p>
 <br>

 <a name= "Data Science"> What is <b>DATA SCIENCE ?</b></a>
 <p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses statistical and computational methods to extract
 insights and knowledge from data. It involves a combination of skills and knowledge from various fields 
 such as statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain expertise. Data Science is kinda blended
 with various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles. Most simply, it involves obtaining meaningful
 information or insights from structured or unstructured data through a process of analyzing, programming, and
 business skills. It is a field containing many elements like mathematics, statistics, computer science, etc. 
 Those who are good at these respective fields with enough knowledge of the domain in which you are willing to 
 work can call themselves as Data Scientist. It’s not an easy thing to do but not impossible too. You need to
 start from data, it’s visualization, programming, formulation, development, and deployment of your model. In
 the future, there will be great hype for data scientist jobs. Taking in that mind, be ready to prepare yourself
 to fit in this world.</p>
<p>Data science is a field that involves using statistical and computational techniques to extract insights and
knowledge from data. It is a multi-disciplinary field that encompasses aspects of computer science, statistics,
 and domain-specific expertise. Data scientists use a variety of tools and methods, such as machine learning, statistical
 modeling, and data visualization, to analyze and make predictions from data. They work with both structured and unstructured
 data, and use the insights gained to inform decision making and support business operations. Data science is applied in a
 wide range of industries, including finance, </p>

 <p>Data science have tremendous impact in machining learning, AI, big data, predictive analytics and decision-making.
 With a marrying of mathematical models, algorithms, and subject-matter knowledge, DSM allows for the effective analysis 
 of large datasets. Data Management is not just about working with data! It is about understanding the data and utilizing
 the output in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is highly likely that as the number of big data-related job openings will only continue to rise, so will the
 number of Data Scientist jobs. The capability of adapting to and commanding different Data Science tools and methodologies
 will become mandatory for any company and/or researcher intending to remain viable and effective in the marketplace as well 
 as in proposing and implementing its decision-making processes. The future of Data Science is brighter still ahead since
 innovations such as artificial intelligence and binning data analytics are evidently the future.</p>

<p>Thus, Data Science as an essential and constantly developing discipline shapes the great many of contemporary global trends.
 It is therefore easier to suggest that anyone interested in the actualization of potentials of data in his/her field of study 
 will need to embrace the principles of the methodologies.</p>
